**Task:** Generate a complete **React** project for a **dental practice website** that is modern, stylish, and optimized to convert visitors into patients. The site should be appropriate for a dentist serving both UK and US audiences (neutral language, easily adaptable contact details). It must be a **standalone static website** (no backend or database), deployable on Vercel. Include a mocked "Contact Us" form (no real submission, just show a success message).

**Project Requirements:**

- **Framework:** Use plain React (e.g., Create React App or Vite) with **React Router** for navigation between pages. Provide all necessary files (JSX, CSS, etc.) for a working multi-page app.
- **Pages & Routes:** Create at least the following pages/components:
  1. **Home Page** – A welcoming overview with conversion-focused elements.
  2. **About Us** – Information about the dentist(s) and practice.
  3. **Services** – Details on general and specialized dental services.
  4. **Contact** – A contact form and practice contact information.
  *(You may also create additional components for navigation, footer, etc.)*

- **Global Design:** 
  - Use a **clean, modern design** with a pleasant color scheme (for example, shades of blue or teal combined with white backgrounds for a trustworthy, calming feel).
  - Ensure the **layout is responsive** (mobile-friendly). Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for flexible layouts. Include a responsive navigation menu (e.g., a hamburger menu on small screens).
  - Use a consistent font pairing (one for headings, one for body text) that looks professional and is easy to read. For example, a sans-serif font for a modern look.
  - Incorporate some imagery: you can use placeholder images (e.g., from `https://via.placeholder.com/`) or reference common stock image URLs for a dentist office, a smiling patient, etc. Every image should have relevant alt text (accessibility).
  - Keep the styling **polished but not overly crowded** – use whitespace and section breaks to avoid clutter.

- **Navigation:** Implement a top navigation bar (perhaps as a `<Navbar>` component) that includes links to Home, About, Services, and Contact. Highlight the current page (if possible). The nav bar should be easily visible and usable on desktop and mobile. On mobile, use a collapsible menu or drawer.

- **Home Page Content:** 
  - A prominent **hero section** with a tagline & brief welcome text. For example:
    - *Headline:* "Welcome to [Practice Name]" (big, friendly text)
    - *Subheadline:* "Your Smile, Our Priority – Quality Dental Care for All Ages"
    - Include a **CTA button** labeled "Book Appointment" or "Contact Us" in this hero section, which when clicked navigates to the Contact page or opens the contact form section.
  - **Differentiators/Highlights:** A row or grid of 3-4 key points about the practice. Each point can have an icon and a short caption. E.g. "🌟 Experienced Team," "🕒 Open Evenings & Weekends," "🏆 Certified & Trusted," "🤝 Affordable Plans". (Use Unicode emojis or icon links for simplicity if no icon library is included.)
  - **Services Summary:** Showcase a few popular services with a photo or icon and name (e.g., "Teeth Whitening", "Dental Implants", "Emergency Dental Care"). Each item could link to the Services page for details. This gives an overview of offerings right on the home page.
  - **Testimonial Snippet:** Include a testimonial quote from a patient (you can invent a name and quote, e.g., *"“Dr. Doe and her staff were amazing – they eased my fear of the dentist!” – Jane S."*). Stylize this as italic or in a quote block. This section can be eye-catching (maybe a different background color).
  - **Call-to-Action Section:** Conclude the home page with a banner or box encouraging action, e.g., *"Ready for a brighter, healthier smile? **Schedule an appointment** with us today!"* alongside another **Book Now button**.

- **About Us Page:** 
  - **Doctor/Team Profile:** Present the lead dentist with a photo (placeholder), name, and credentials (e.g., DDS, DMD, BDS). Add a short bio emphasizing a caring approach and experience (e.g., "Dr. Jane Doe has 15+ years of experience helping patients achieve healthy smiles in a comfortable environment...").
  - **Mission Statement or Philosophy:** A paragraph about what the practice stands for (e.g., patient comfort, state-of-the-art care, treating patients like family).
  - **Office Image:** If possible, include another image (e.g., the office or team). This makes the page more personable.
  - **Maybe Timeline or Fun Fact:** (Optional) E.g., "Serving the community since 2005" or "Over 10,000 smiles transformed".
  - Ensure the tone remains welcoming and professional.

- **Services Page:**
  - Organize this page by categories of services. You can structure it as:
    - **Preventive Care:** (e.g., exams, cleanings, X-rays) – list and briefly describe each.
    - **Restorative Treatments:** (e.g., fillings, crowns, bridges, dentures).
    - **Cosmetic Dentistry:** (e.g., teeth whitening, veneers, Invisalign).
    - **Specialty Services:** (e.g., dental implants, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry, emergency care).
  - Each service description should be 1-3 sentences, focusing on **benefits to the patient**. For example: *"**Teeth Whitening** – Brighten your smile by several shades in just one visit, using safe professional whitening techniques."*
  - You can use bullet points or subheadings for each service category. If the list is long, make it visually digestible (maybe collapsible sections or simply well-separated paragraphs).
  - Optionally, include a small image or icon next to each category or key service for visual appeal.
  - End the services page with a reminder CTA: e.g., *"Have questions about our services? [Contact us](#) and we'll be happy to help or book you in for a consultation."*

- **Contact Page:**
  - **Contact Form:** Create a form with fields: Name, Email, Phone, and Message (all as controlled inputs in React state). Use proper labels and placeholders (e.g., "Your Name", "Your Email"). The form should validate basic required fields (and email format if possible). On submit, prevent the default action and instead display a success message on the page (for example, replace the form with a `<p>` that says "Thank you for reaching out! We will get back to you shortly." or simply use an `alert("Thank you...")`). *No actual backend integration is needed.*
  - **Contact Information:** Beside or below the form, list:
    - **Phone:** e.g., "+1 (234) 567-8900". Make it clickable: `<a href="tel:+12345678900">+1 (234) 567-8900</a>`.
    - **Email:** e.g., "contact@yourdentist.com" with a mailto link.
    - **Address:** e.g., "123 Dental St, Hometown, ST 12345". For a UK twist, it could be "10 High Street, Hometown, UK". (You can pick one format; the site owner will adapt it.)
    - **Hours:** e.g., "Mon-Fri 9:00am - 6:00pm; Sat 9:00am - 1:00pm".
    - If possible, embed a Google Map showing a placeholder location (optional). This can be done with an `<iframe>` using a Google Maps URL for "Hometown".
  - Encourage the user to contact: a sentence like *"We welcome new patients! Feel free to call or message us – our friendly team is here to answer any questions."*

- **Global Components:** 
  - **Header/NavBar:** Create a header component with the clinic name/logo on the left (it can just be text like "[Practice Name]" styled as a logo) and the nav menu links on the right. The "Book Appointment" button could also appear in the header as a standout item (perhaps styled differently to draw attention).
  - **Footer:** Create a footer with: practice name, address, contact info, and perhaps © 2026 [Practice Name]. You might also include links to social media (even if they just point to "#", as placeholders for now).
  - Apply consistent styling to the header and footer (e.g., a background color bar, padding, and legible text).

- **Styling:** You can use plain CSS (either a global CSS file or CSS Modules/Styled Components as you prefer). Ensure:
  - Text colors have good contrast against backgrounds.
  - Links and buttons have hover states for interactivity (e.g., a slight darken or underline on hover).
  - The design should **look good on desktop and mobile**. Test by simulating different screen widths: the layout should reflow nicely (e.g., the services could stack vertically on narrow screens, the nav menu might collapse).
  - Use media queries in CSS as needed for responsiveness (e.g., hide the regular menu and show hamburger icon on small screens).

- **Accessibility & Best Practices:**
  - Add `alt` attributes to all images (e.g., alt="Dentist examining a patient").
  - Use appropriate HTML elements (e.g., use `<form>` for the form, `<button>` for buttons, headings in logical order `h1, h2, h3` for content structure).
  - Ensure the site title is set (e.g., in HTML `<title>Your Practice Name - Dentist</title>`).
  - No console errors or React key warnings, etc., in the code.

**Output:** 
Provide the complete source code for this React application. Structure the answer by file if possible, for clarity (e.g., `App.js`, `index.js`, `Navbar.jsx`, `Home.jsx`, `About.jsx`, `Services.jsx`, `Contact.jsx`, and any CSS files). Ensure that someone could copy the code into a new React project and run it immediately. You can include comments in the code to explain sections.

```
// (The answer should now present the code files like so:)
**index.js:**
```jsx
// index.js content here
```

**App.js:**
```jsx
// App.js content here, including Router setup and routes
```

**components/Navbar.jsx:**
```jsx
// Navbar component with links
```

**pages/Home.jsx:**
```jsx
// Home page component with JSX for hero, highlights, etc.
```

...and so on for About, Services, Contact, plus CSS files or inline styles as needed.
